    "question": "Tell me about yourself.",
    "answer": "I'm an engineering graduate with a passion for problem-solving and project coordination. I recently completed a master's program where I specialized in [your field], and I also participated in the Unitech leadership program. My background includes both technical work and team management—from running operations at a sailing school to coordinating international alumni events. I’m now looking to apply my skills in a role that combines strategy, teamwork, and innovation."

  {
    "question": "Why do you want to work here?",
    "answer": "I'm impressed by your company’s commitment to innovation and sustainable growth. I’ve read about your recent projects in [specific field], and they align closely with my own interests. I’m particularly excited by your collaborative work culture and would love to contribute my project management and research skills to support your goals."

  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time you showed leadership.",
    "answer": "When I managed a sailing school, I led a team of instructors through a particularly busy summer season. We faced staff shortages, so I reorganized the schedule and trained junior instructors, which helped us continue operations smoothly. As a result, we received record-high customer feedback scores that season."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe a challenge you’ve faced and how you handled it.",
    "answer": "In a recent alumni project, we had last-minute cancellations from key speakers. I quickly coordinated with our network, secured replacements, and restructured the program within 24 hours. The event ran successfully and even exceeded attendance expectations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you approach a new project or problem?",
    "answer": "I start by clarifying the objective and key constraints. Then, I break the project into phases, gather relevant data, and consult with stakeholders. I often use tools like Miro or Notion for planning and Trello for task tracking. I believe in iterative improvement and clear communication throughout."
  },
  {
    "question": "Tell me about a technical concept you’ve worked with.",
    "answer": "In my thesis, I explored fake info. I used Python and various data processing libraries to build a model that identified early warning signs in equipment. It was a great exercise in both research and applied engineering."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle conflict or issues in a team?",
    "answer": "I approach it by listening first. In one case, two team members disagreed on task responsibilities. I facilitated a short meeting where each explained their concerns, then we redefined roles together. Open communication helped us avoid future friction."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you prioritize your work when juggling multiple tasks?",
    "answer": "I use the Eisenhower Matrix to distinguish urgent vs. important tasks. I also regularly review my priorities and communicate proactively with teammates to align deadlines and manage expectations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are your strengths and weaknesses?",
    "answer": "My strengths include structured thinking and being calm under pressure. A weakness I’m working on is delegating more—I used to take on too much myself, but I’ve learned that trusting the team improves both output and morale."

  {
    "question": "Do you have any questions for us?",
    "answer": "Yes, I'd love to know more about your team culture. How do you support continuous learning and development?"
