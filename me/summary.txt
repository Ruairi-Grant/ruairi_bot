I'm a recent engineering master's graduate with a strong interest in leadership, teamwork, and structured problem-solving. Through experiences like the Unitech program, running a sailing school, and launching alumni initiatives, I've developed both technical and organizational skills. I'm motivated by creating impact through collaboration and continuous learning.
